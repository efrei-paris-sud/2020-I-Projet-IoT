## I2C communciation
In this question, we need to read and understand how works the I2C communication.

This protocol proceed with two channels: SDA and SCL
the SDA port handles all the transmission of data and the SCl is the clock line which handles the starting time of each task.
Both SDA and SCL are the link between the master component and the slaves.
SDA is dedicated to pin A4 on the arduino card and SCL to pin A5.
