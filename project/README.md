# Project Title: NASpberry
![Raspberry](https://github.com/efrei-paris-sud/2020-I-Projet-IoT/blob/main/assets/Raspberry-pic.jpg)

**Description:**  Main parts of the project
 - [x] **Creation of the physical NAS** 
 - [x] **Set up of the OS**
 - [x] **Data transmission between a PC/smartphone and the NAS**
 - [x] **Addition of a wireless sensor**
 - [x] **Controll the NAS with a remote controller**

This whole procedure will make us able to store and retrieve data from a NAS and controll it as if it was a TV to switch it on/off and do some basic actions. We tried to make sure that all requirements (Sensors, actuators, data processing, and information transmission) are met.
