# Project Title: NASpberry
 **Description**: The aim of the project is to create a NAS from scratch with a raspberry PI. Finally, the goal is to controll the NAS with a remote controller in order to switch it on/off. We will also assign to the other buttons some specific actions to make our NAS more versatile. The latter functions will be added to make sure that a sensor and an actuator are involved in the project.
